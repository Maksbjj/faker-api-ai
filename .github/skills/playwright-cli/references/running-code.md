# Running Custom Playwright Code

Use `run-code` to execute arbitrary Playwright code for advanced scenarios not covered by CLI commands.

## Syntax

```bash
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  // Your Playwright code here
  // Access page.context() for browser context operations
}"
```

## Geolocation

```bash
# Grant geolocation permission and set location
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.context().grantPermissions(['geolocation']);
  await page.context().setGeolocation({ latitude: 37.7749, longitude: -122.4194 });
}"

# Set location to London
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.context().grantPermissions(['geolocation']);
  await page.context().setGeolocation({ latitude: 51.5074, longitude: -0.1278 });
}"

# Clear geolocation override
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.context().clearPermissions();
}"
```

## Permissions

```bash
# Grant multiple permissions
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.context().grantPermissions([
    'geolocation',
    'notifications',
    'camera',
    'microphone'
  ]);
}"
```

## Media Emulation

```bash
# Emulate dark color scheme
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.emulateMedia({ colorScheme: 'dark' });
}"
```
